## Abstract

XID (eXistence ID) is a proposal for a decentralized identity layer built on the XRP Ledger. It aims to provide individuals with a portable, secure, and privacy-focused digital identity that can be verified globally without relying on centralized authorities. The system incorporates features such as emergency access (Life Mode), data sovereignty, and cross-border recognition.

## Motivation

The need for a universally recognized digital identity has become essential in an increasingly interconnected world. Current identity systems are fragmented, centralized, and exclusionary. XID addresses this by offering a sovereign identity anchored in the XRP Ledger, promoting human rights, privacy, and global inclusion.

## Specification

### Identity Structure

- Each XID is a unique account or object on the XRPL.
- The XID stores:
  - Personal metadata (optional)
  - Linked decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
  - Credential attestations
  - Emergency contact data (Life Mode)

### Life Mode (Emergency Mode)

- A shielded access layer that enables emergency services or designated parties to retrieve vital information.
- Can be toggled on/off via a secure mechanism (multisig, secret flag, etc.)
- Example: medical data, next of kin, biometrics hash.

### Privacy & Control

- Zero-knowledge proof compatible.
- User controls what data is visible and to whom.
- Revocable data sharing.

### Use Cases

- Digital passports and migration
- Universal login and KYC replacement
- Emergency identity recovery
- Voting, finance, healthcare access

## Implementation Notes

- XID can be implemented via XRPL NFTs or new ledger objects (to be defined).
- Could integrate with Interledger Protocol for wider use.
- May use Hooks for reactive behavior (e.g. Life Mode triggers).

## Vision

XID envisions a future where your identity is truly yours — not owned by any government or platform, but verifiable and useful everywhere.

**Tagline:**  
*XID: Your life, your key, your network.*
